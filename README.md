# FINAL PROJECT — GROUP 4  
# 🧠 Find IT

**Find IT** is a web app we built as the final project of a 4-month full-time programming bootcamp. None of us had any prior experience in tech, and over this journey, we learned to build full-stack applications from the ground up.

This project reflects both our technical growth and our desire to help others who are thinking about switching to a tech career but aren’t sure where to begin.

## 🚀 What is Find IT?

Find IT helps people discover which tech careers match their unique combination of **soft skills** and **hard skills**. 

Here’s how it works:

- 🧭 Users complete a profile with their behavioral and technical skills.
- 💡 We match that data with a curated database of tech careers using a custom logic.
- 📚 The app then recommends suitable roles and builds a **custom learning path** for each user.
- 📈 Progress can be tracked inside a personal dashboard.
- 🔒 There's a full **auth system** with registration, login, and password hashing using bcrypt.
- 💼 In the future, we thought about planning to offer training courses directly through the platform.

## 🛠️ What We Used

We built this app using the **MERN stack**, plus some tools we picked up along the way:

- **Frontend**
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  - HTML + JavaScript
  - CSS and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- **Backend**
  - Node.js + Express.js
  - MongoDB Atlas
  - Bcrypt for secure authentication

## 👨‍💻 Meet the Team

This project was built by four developers who started from scratch:

- Karolaine Morgado  
- Lorena Barradas  
- Renan Janz  
- Vinicius Silva

We worked as a team from day one — planning, designing, prototyping, coding, debugging, and learning together. Along the way, we practiced:

- Core programming concepts
- Full-stack development (MERN)
- Git & GitHub for collaboration
- Agile workflows and stand-ups

## 🧪 Key Features

- User registration and login
- Auth system with JWT and hashed passwords
- Profile form for skills and personality input
- Career-matching algorithm
- Personalized study roadmap by career
- Progress tracking dashboard

## 🎯 Why We Built It

We wanted to make something useful for people like us — curious, motivated, but unsure where to begin in tech. Find IT is meant to be a **friendly guide** for anyone trying to figure out which role suits them and how to get there.
